## Color Coding System

The components use a consistent color coding system based on scores:

- **Green (80-100)**: Excellent performance
  - `text-green-600`, `bg-green-50`, `border-green-200`
- **Yellow (60-79)**: Good performance, room for improvement
  - `text-yellow-600`, `bg-yellow-50`, `border-yellow-200`
- **Red (0-59)**: Needs significant improvement
  - `text-red-600`, `bg-red-50`, `border-red-200`

## Responsive Design

All components are designed mobile-first with responsive breakpoints:

- **Mobile (< 1024px)**: Single column layout, stacked components
- **Desktop (â‰¥ 1024px)**: Split-screen layout with side-by-side panels

## Testing

Each component includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Rendering with different score ranges
- User interactions (clicks, expansions)
- Prop variations and edge cases
- Accessibility considerations
